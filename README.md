# Emotion Recognition using CNNs

A basic project to understand the working of convolutional neural networks on a live video stream. 
The model tries to predict a user's emotions based on their facial features using a deep CNN.
The emotions it can predict are:

1) ANGRY
2) DISGUST
3) FEAR
4) HAPPY
5) NEUTRAL
6) SAD
7) SURPRISE

To try out the model, download or clone the repo using

```
git clone https://github.com/PandaBoi/Emotion_REcoG.git
```
and run stream.py using

```
python stream.py
```
